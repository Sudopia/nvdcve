The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of certain 802.11 management information element frames that an affected device receives from wireless clients. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed 802.11 management frame to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects only Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers that are running Cisco Mobility Express Release 8.5.103.0. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg07024."
